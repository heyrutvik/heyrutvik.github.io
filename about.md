My name is Rutvik. Iâ€™m a software developer from Gujarat, India. Scala and Javascript are languages of my choice at work. 

I got drawn toward the programming in hope to become a game developer and have been tangled in web development ever since. Then got interested in *mathematics*, and now I learn/do programming for the sake of programming. I like *programming language theory*, *type theory* and to some extent *physics*.
