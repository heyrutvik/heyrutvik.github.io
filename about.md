My name is Rutvik. Iâ€™m a software engineer from India.

I got drawn toward programming in hope to become a game developer and have been tangled in web development ever since. Over the span of my career, I've worked on distributed systems and simulations. Other than that, I'm interested in game physics, Linux kernel and machine learning.
